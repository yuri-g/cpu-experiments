CPU simulation in LogisimEvolution, just for fun.
I've always been fascinated by the low-level programming and hardware, so in order to understand how exactly the computers work, I'm trying to make a simple CPU in [Logisim](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution).

## Current state:
Simple adder/substractor (without proper overflow detection):

Just an interesting course I should probably take a look at:  
[Great Ideas in Computer Architecture](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa19/)
